# register-machine

Summary of register machines, and their basic implementation, is [available
here.](https://dylant.org/register-machines-in-haskell).

This project seeks to implement register machines in Haskell, with
consideration for
- freely extensible instruction set using Sums
- macros using assembly system / submachines
- support for nondeterministic instructions using the cofree comonad and
  recursion schemes
