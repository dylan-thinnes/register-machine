# register-machine

Summary of register machines, and their basic implementation, is [available
here.](https://dylant.org/register-machines-in-haskell).

This project seeks to implement register machines in Haskell, with
consideration for extensible instructions, parsing, macros, custom labels, and
nondeterminism.
